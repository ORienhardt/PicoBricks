PicoBricks Robot Car Kit, is a wooden project kit that uses two DC motors and tracks. We can remotely control the mini tank with the remote control thanks to the IR receiver on it. The mini tank has a distance sensor in the front, allowing it to detect objects and make movement decisions accordingly.
